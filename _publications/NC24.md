excerpt: 'Data proliferation in the digital age necessitates robust encryption techniques to protect information privacy. Optical encryption leverages the multiple degrees of freedom inherent in light waves to encode information with parallel processing and enhanced security features. However, implementations of large-scale, high-security optical encryption have largely remained theoretical or limited to digital simulations due to hardware constraints, signal-to-noise ratio challenges, and precision fabrication of encoding elements. Here, we present an optical encryption platform utilizing scattering multiplexing ptychography, simultaneously enhancing security and throughput. Unlike optical encoders which rely on computer-generated randomness, our approach leverages the inherent complexity of light scattering as a natural unclonable function. This enables multi-dimensional encoding with superior randomness. Furthermore, the ptychographic configuration expands encryption throughput beyond hardware limitations through spatial multiplexing of different scatterer regions. We propose a hybrid decryption algorithm integrating model- and data-driven strategies, ensuring robust decryption against various sources of measurement noise and communication interference. We achieved optical encryption at a scale of ten-megapixel pixels with 1.23 Âµm resolution. Communication experiments validate the resilience of our decryption algorithm, yielding high-fidelity results even under extreme transmission conditions characterized by a 20% bit error rate. Our encryption platform offers a holistic solution for large-scale, high-security, and cost-effective cryptography.'
