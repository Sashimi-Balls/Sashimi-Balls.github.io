After applying for a [Japanese visa](../../../../2024/05/15/JPVISA/), I quickly purchased a ticket to embark on my first trip to Japan. This being my first time traveling abroad alone, I made thorough preparations, which I’m documenting here for future reference.



# About Packing

Due to budget constraints, I opted for a (quasi) low-cost airline, which meant limited baggage allowance. To avoid potential overweight charges at the airport, I chose a 25L hiking backpack and a very small camera sling bag.

The weather in Japan starts to heat up in June, although many people still wear long sleeves, short sleeves are sufficient to ward off the slight chill in the mornings and evenings. Therefore, within the limited backpack space, I packed short sleeves for **daily changes**. The only thin jacket I brought was worn from the moment I boarded the plane. Pants can be fewer, but basic **sun protection** clothing is necessary.

Some attractions in Japan may require you to take off your shoes, so it's advisable to bring a few pairs of clean socks.

In addition to clothing, there are other daily necessities. If there isn't enough space to carry them, you can buy them in Japan, where there are many drugstores, and many clerks even speak Mandarin (mostly Taiwan tone). If you have samples or travel sizes, consider bringing moisturizers, sunscreen, itch relief, vitamins, mouthwash, and other simple medications.

Most Japanese hotels provide basic disposable amenities, so it's recommended to bring your toothbrush, razor, and other personal items.

Also carry emergency medications as needed.



# Flight and Accommodation

For reference, a round-trip ticket from Hong Kong International Airport HKG to Kansai International Airport KIX on Hong Kong Airlines[^1] costs about `HK$`1,300. Prices may increase during peak seasons. Corresponding flights on Cathay Pacific generally cost around `HK$`3,000.

Accommodation prices in the Kansai region are quite affordable, with prices for 5-star hotels on `Trip` sometimes as low as `HK$`500. However, hotel conditions vary. Here are two recommended hotels:

1. [Kobe Bay Sheraton Hotel & Towers](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/osakb-kobe-bay-sheraton-hotel-towers/overview): Located near Uozaki Station, you can transfer to the Rokkō Island Line to Marine Park. The hotel is at the second-to-last stop, in the center of the island. During off-peak seasons, you can often find deals for `HK$`500-600, and the stay experience is quite good.
2. [Rihga Royal Hotel Kyoto](https://www.rihgaroyalkyoto.com/): If time is limited, I recommend spending more days in Kyoto, Uji, and Nara compared to Osaka. This hotel has a regular shuttle bus to Kyoto Station, and its accommodation conditions are similar to those of the Sheraton. There’s also a FamilyMart convenience store downstairs.

Japan's tourism industry is very developed, with countless hotels offering good experiences. If you're on a tight budget, you can consider staying in ordinary three-star hotels, which also provide a decent experience.

This specific Sheraton does not check passport information upon check-in, while most other hotels do require passport registration. If you’re departing from Hong Kong with a stay visa, the airport will also need to check your HKID.

# About Japan

Japan is undoubtedly a developed country, with many infrastructures designed to serve as a "tourist nation". The airport/rail system and attractions feature text and audio in Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and English. The standardized hotel supply chain, unique urban planning, and scenic spot development, as well as many customized travel services, make Japan a highly recommended first stop for nearby travel.

However, there are still many things that first-time visitors to Japan need to know in advance.

## Public Transportation

Japan's public transportation seems to strike a balance between China and the West. It’s not as expensive to maintain as China's, but it’s also not as lacking as in many parts of the United States.

Japan’s railway system is very well-developed, but its planning is completely different from China’s. Due to Japan’s relatively large land area, with many cities built on flat and sloped areas below mountains, Japan’s railway system is like a fusion of China’s subway and regular railway systems.

For example, the above-ground railway, commonly referred to as 電車 (Densha) in Japan, stops at different stations depending on the train schedule. Local trains stop at all stations, while rapid trains (Rapid), limited express trains (Limited Express), and other faster trains stop at fewer stations, though they all run on the same tracks. This is similar to China's train system, but because Japan’s land area is not as vast as China’s, they can build the train system like a subway system. People used to domestic subways should check the timetable when entering stations in Japan. Additionally, different lines at the same station may be operated by different railway companies, requiring passengers to re-enter the station when transferring.

It’s worth mentioning that while different areas may recommend different subway cards, in practice, the Kansai region allows seamless use of Suica, though you might not be able to enjoy local discounts. The NFC protocol of Suica makes its recognition speed very fast, much faster than the current domestic transportation union NFC protocol. The design of Hong Kong's Octopus card is also likely derived from Japan.

## 「Clean City」

A striking feature of Japan is the scarcity of trash cans in cities, usually only found near convenience stores and vending machines. Sometimes, you have to take your trash back to the hotel for disposal.

*Moreover, in places where there are trash cans, few people follow the garbage classification rules.*

## Electrical Specifications

Japan uses a 100V voltage specification, with different frequencies in the east and west. However, low-power accessories like computer and phone chargers can generally be used directly, though they might not reach their rated power. Two-prong plugs from mainland China don't require an adapter, but three-prong ones might need to be converted to two-prong. I rarely saw three-prong outlets in Japan, as their household appliance standards are all two-prong (their grounding is connected separately for high-power appliances, which is inconvenient).

The flight departed from HKG, flew over Taiwan, and landed at KIX. I woke up just as we were passing over Taichung, which was my original travel plan.

Upon arriving at KIX, we were hit by a tropical cyclone (or was it a typhoon?) from the Philippines, and it was raining throughout the Kansai region. Taking the ferry from KIX to Kobe Airport, I encountered the rush hour crowd.

The first photo I took after leaving the hotel the next day was nervously overexposed, and even the focus was incorrect. The sun was very strong the day after the rain, giving the street a distinctly anime-like feel.

Without wasting a moment mourning the bad photo, I immediately rushed to the place where the hero king and the emperor fought! Just in time to see the Norwegian Star docked at Kobe Port, I had to squeeze a giant into the iconic Fate scene XD.

Kobe is said to be one of the earliest areas opened to foreigners, retaining some foreign-style buildings, some of which are still exhibited, such as those near Kitano Ijinkan. This building was used as the setting for Tohsaka Rin's residence in the Fate series.

Kobe feels like a very wealthy and livable city. Unfortunately, I couldn’t make it to the top of Mount Maya on the last day due to time constraints, otherwise, I could have seen the "million-dollar night view" that the Japanese rave about :P

I didn’t have a specific plan for Osaka, and the actual experience wasn’t great. Osaka Castle was the first destination, but it’s a reconstructed castle, and Himeji Castle is actually more worth visiting.

<div>

The Glico sign is almost a landmark that every visitor to Osaka must check in with.

Believe it or not, I saw a Hong Kong-style restaurant in Osaka. The Tsutenkaku Tower in the background isn’t very tall, but you can choose to slide down from the top, which is very exciting.

I haven’t had time to edit the photos from Kyoto, but I feel there are more places worth visiting. The most worthwhile for me is Fushimi Inari Taisha, said to be the head shrine of all Inari shrines in Japan. Coincidentally or not, it was raining during my visit, which greatly enhanced the saturation of the red and green inside the shrine, and there were far fewer tourists than usual, making it easy to capture moments of solitude.

And by convention, +1s

It wasn’t until the last few days that I realized an important aspect of traveling in Japan is to get up early. By mid-morning, the Ninenzaka and Sannenzaka areas were already crowded with people, but I still managed to find the iconic spots.
