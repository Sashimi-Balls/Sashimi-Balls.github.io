The program for ICC'24 conference was released today on EDAS. During my free time today, I made a brief statistical analysis of the results. Please note that I cannot guarantee the accuracy of the results, so please use them with caution.

This year's ICC received a total of 935 submissions, involving 3,282 authors from 1,223 academic institutions including universities and research institutes.

Similar to other communication conferences, this conference focuses on topics related to networks and communications. The distribution of keywords is as follows.

In this conference, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (`北京邮电大学`) ranks first in both the number of authors and papers. They have published 43 papers with the involvement of 107 authors.

The statistical results based on academic institution paper counts are shown in the above image.

The distribution of papers by country/region is as follows:

Since the same paper may involve multiple countries/regions, the sum of the paper counts in the image will be greater than the total number of papers (935). It also demonstrates the level of collaboration in the field of communications in mainland China (excluding Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) on a global scale.

The first author's affiliated academic institutions are as follows:

Correspondingly, the distribution of first authors by country/region is as follows:

These are the simple distribution statistics for ICC'24. I will provide periodic updates based on the actual situation.
